CipherYou uses AES encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation, ensuring strong security:
- PBKDF2 Key Derivation â€“ Prevents brute-force attacks.
- Unique Salt for Each Encryption â€“ Ensures every encryption is unique.
- 12-Character Minimum Password â€“ Blocks weak passwords.
- Three Tries, Then Lockout â€“ Stops repeated password guessing.
- Metadata Protection â€“ Keeps file information hidden.
- Secure File Deletion â€“ Original files are erased after encryption.

## ðŸ›  How It Works

#### 1. Open CipherYou and select Encrypt a File.
#### 2. Choose a file and enter a strong password.
#### 3. The file is encrypted and the original securely erased.

To decrypt, simply select an encrypted file (.enc), enter the correct password (3 attempts max), and restore your file.
